          With its seamless customization options that make it the perfect
          addition to rooms of any size, it’s no wonder IKEA’s BILLY bookcase
          series has become a beloved classic around the world. BILLY bookcases
          are built with a stackable design that allows you to attach new units
          whenever you need additional storage, just decide on what height suits
          your space best. Every model in the BILLY series also features
          adjustable shelves so you can fit anything from books to trophies, and
          everything in between.
